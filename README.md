Explorations into [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a Sequence Modeling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14953). See my [note](https://mwolf.dev/general/Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-is-a-Sequence-Modeling-Problem) on interesting theoretical takeaways.

  <summary>Abandoned roadmap.</summary>

It's kinda funny in hindsight.

### TODO

- [ ] Benchmark
- [ ] Kolmogorov complexity comparator badge to compare with OG impl
- [ ] seqlen > nagents 
  - [ ] short action history useful?
  - [ ] hidden agents (STM context / registers)
- [ ] GATO (multi-modal, multi-task)
- [ ] Streaming Deep RL

### Appreciation

- [The 37 Implementation Details of Proximal Policy Optimization](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/); a great resource for many big and small details in the implementation of PPO.
